    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Fife Taxi Price</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use our quote
        calculator and distance features. This app is designed to generate fare estimates based on distance and optional waiting time.
      </p>
      <p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We use Google services to calculate routes and distances when you request them.</li>
      <li>If you tap “Use my location”, your device may share your location to provide a pickup point.</li>
      <li>We display advertising in the Android app (AdMob). Advertising partners may collect device identifiers for ad delivery and measurement.</li>
      <li>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, and we do not sell your personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information we process</h2>
    <h3>1) Location (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose “Use my location”, your device’s browser/OS may provide an approximate or precise location. We use it only to set the pickup
      location for distance calculations. You can always type a pickup address instead.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Addresses you enter</h3>
    <p>
      Pickup and drop-off addresses (or places) you type are used to calculate distance and generate a fare estimate. These values are processed
      to provide the requested functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>3) App usage and device information</h3>
    <p>
      The Android app may process basic technical information required for operation (e.g., app version, device type, and diagnostic information),
      and advertising partners may process identifiers for ad delivery and measurement (see “Advertising” below).
    </p>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provide quotes:</strong> calculate miles/kilometres and estimate fares using the fare rules configured in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Route and distance:</strong> obtain route distance between pickup and drop-off when you request it.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve reliability:</strong> diagnose errors and improve performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> show ads to help fund operation of the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google Maps / Places / Directions</h2>
    <p>
      When you use distance features, the app uses Google APIs (such as Maps JavaScript API and Places) to provide address suggestions and compute
      route distance. Your use of Google services is subject to Google’s terms and privacy policy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
      <li>Google Terms of Service: <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/terms</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>
      The Android app may show ads provided by Google AdMob. AdMob and its partners may collect and use information such as device identifiers,
      IP address, approximate location (from IP), and ad interaction events to serve and measure ads, prevent fraud, and improve ad performance.
      We do not control how third parties process data; their processing is governed by their own policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services here:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>
      We share information only as needed to provide the service:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google APIs:</strong> for route/distance and place suggestions when you request them.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising partners (AdMob):</strong> for ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention in the Android app.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> if we use hosting/analytics providers, they may process limited technical data to operate the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal:</strong> if required to comply with law or protect rights/safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      The web-based calculator is designed to operate without storing your entered trip details on our servers. If we add server-side features in the
      future (e.g., accounts, saved quotes), we will update this policy and describe retention periods.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> you can deny location permission and type a pickup address instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Ads:</strong> ad settings and personalisation controls may be available in your device settings and Google account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser controls:</strong> you can clear site data/cookies in your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable measures to protect the app and its configuration. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Third-party providers (such as Google) may process information on servers located in different countries. Their policies govern how such
      processing occurs.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the effective date above, and material changes will be posted on this page.
